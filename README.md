# Net n Chill
Sample iOS Swift for receiving and display available movies. DB using: TMDb
- MVVM Structure.
- API level using URLSession with abstraction wrapper.
- RxSwift.
- UI using UIKit specific storyboards

Note:
- URLSession with Codable models and Storyboards are very basic, newbie will found it very similar for what they studied thus reduce their learning time.
- Abstraction wrapper: follows Moya library, robust, easier to adding or removing API and easier to debug network layer.
- RxSwift: as recommended, i'm' not so good at this but tried my best to do the job.
- UI design: inspired a lot from Netflix and other streaming app like iQIYI. Dark makes people will things they are in the theatre, and as a developer once said: dark is a friend of eyes.
- Unit Testing: To be honest, all my projects i've doing before didn't write unit test cases so much, so i tried my best to do it.
